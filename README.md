# US Road Accident Analysis
Here we perform few analysis operation on the dataset which contains 49 states among the United States, which contains the accident details taken palce in United states during 2016-2021

# Dataset:
The Data Contains 47 Columns with more than 2 million of the data.The data set has been collected in real time, multiple analysis of traffic API during 2016-2021 in United states. The dataset contains location, weather conditions which helps in analyzing the reasons for the accidents that are occurred in united states during 2016-2021

# Libraries required:

Pandas

Numpy

Matplotlib

seaborn

sklearn

# Platform need to use for project:

Jupyter Notebook

Google Colab

Visual Studio Code

# Installation of Jupyter Notebook:

Install Jupyter Notebook: To use Jupyter Notebook, you will need to have it installed on your computer. You can install it by following the link (https://jupyter.org/install).

Open the IPYNB file that is uploaded in the Canvas through following instructions:

Click on the open file on the left corner of the jupyter notebook.

Go to the location where you downloaded the file and open the file in the jupyter notebook platform.


# How To Run the Project:
Step-1: Download the dataset from the Kaggle repository https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents.

Step-2: If you are using the dataset from your local machine copy the path in the first cell at df = pd.read_csv("Paste the dataset path here").

Step-3: If your using Colab make your dataset is uploaded in drive if need here is my drive link:

Step-4: Run all the cells to get the output.

Note: If you are facing issues on the above libraries try to install !pip install (library name).

# What we are trying to answer:

How does the severity of accidents vary based on different factors such as weather, road
surface and others.

Identify the Hotspots in the country with respective accidents

Identify the places with highest accident on the interstate highways in United states with
time factors?

# Limitations:

Due Memory Issues for some machine Learning Predictions and Clustering We had used only small amount of the Data.
